# Building an eCommerce Platform from Scratch

I had the opportunity to support a friendâ€™s vision by helping him launch his own clothing brand through a fully developed eCommerce website. This became my most ambitious project to date and a valuable chance to grow my development skills. I aimed to create a complete, production-ready platform that could be hosted and published to the web.

The site included essential eCommerce features such as user authentication, allowing customers to securely register, log in, and manage their accounts. I built a product catalog with pagination to ensure smooth and responsive browsing, even with a growing inventory. A shopping cart and checkout system enabled users to manage their purchases and place orders through an intuitive interface. On the backend, I implemented order handling and basic data management to track user activity and maintain operational flow.

I also took full responsibility for hosting and deployment, configuring environments, securing API keys, and managing the infrastructure to keep the site live and accessible. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in full-stack development and significantly improved both my design and technical abilities.
